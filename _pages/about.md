<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student under the advisory of Prof. [Defu Lian](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~liandefu/) and Prof. [Kai Zheng](https://zheng-kai.com/) in School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC). I got my B.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2018. My research interests include recommender systems, negative sampling and information retrieval.
